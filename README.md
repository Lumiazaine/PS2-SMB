# PS2-SMB

This is a simple script that will configure a samba server with the folders to simply add our game backups and forget about configuring the server part

# Why this project?

As you can see this is the fastest PS2 transfer speed with OPL

| Interface     | Maximum theoretically speed                                |
| ------------- |:----------------------------------------------------------:|
| HDD ATA       | ATA-66 (Roughly 66MB/s)                                    |
| Ethernet      | 100Mbit (Or 12.5MB/s)                                      |
| USB 1.1       | 12Mbit (~1.5 MB/s)                                         |
| CD/DVD        | 24x speed CD-ROM [3.6 MB/s] , 4x speed DVD-ROM [5.28 MB/s] |

In a PS2 Slim we can't get the HDD ATA interface beacuse, we haven't the expansion bay or we haven't the PS2 network adaptaer on our PS2 Fat.
